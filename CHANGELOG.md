# Changelog

All notable changes to CFM are recorded here.

**Versioning is date-based: the version *is* the release date** (`YYYY.MM.DD`,
from `date +%Y.%m.%d` in the Makefile). Each released `.deb`/`.rpm` produced by
`make release` carries that day's date, so every dated heading below
corresponds to a real package that was built and `make sync`'d out.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/):
group entries under **Added / Changed / Fixed / Security / Removed**. Work in
progress accumulates under **[Unreleased]**; on release day it moves under a
new `## YYYY.MM.DD` heading (see CLAUDE.md → "Releasing & CHANGELOG").

History before this file (the first ~1000 PRs, Mar–Jun 2026) is not
back-filled here — see the git/PR history for that period.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- MySQL governor: scoped (cPanel) users can now **kill their own stuck
  query/connection** — `POST /api/v1/mysql/user-kill?id=<pid>&type=query|connection`
  (default `query` = KILL QUERY, statement only). The target connection's
  `(user, db)` must be within the token's scope (admin tokens may target any);
  every kill is recorded in the governor audit ring/history. Scoped governor
  reads (`user-summary`/`user-kills`/`user-history`) were already live.

### Fixed
- Admin UI: scoped (cPanel) users no longer see admin-only nav items. The nav
  filter only hid the Dashboard; **Web Bots, Notifier, Detectors, Settings and
  Debug stayed visible** to scoped users and 403'd on click. The authoritative
  admin-only nav list now covers all of them (backends were already
  fail-closed; this removes the dead/broken links). Also removed a stale
  divergent matcher copy in `ui-scope.js` and corrected
  `docs/endpoint_scope_inventory.md` (which wrongly listed the scope-validated
  `waf/engine/summary` and `{challenge,waf}/exclude/*` endpoints as admin-only).

### Security
- `POST /api/v1/firewall/block` is now **admin-only server-side** (wrapped in
  `adminOnlyHandler`, like the MySQL/detectors/system-status routes).
  Previously the route had no role/scope check, so a scoped (cPanel/DA) token
  could call it directly and block any IP host-wide — bypassing the UI, which
  already hid the action. The customer-facing unblock endpoint is unchanged.

### Fixed
- Admin UI: scoped (cPanel) viewer tokens can now toggle **Challenge/WAF and
  HTTP/3 for their own in-scope vhosts** from the per-vhost controls. The
  client-side write guard was blanket-blocking all writes for `viewer` tokens
  (`read-only scoped viewer token`) even though the daemon already authorises
  these mutations by host scope. Self-service writes are re-allowed client-side
  (the server still enforces the vhost allowlist); genuinely admin-only writes
  stay blocked. Also classifies `v1/waf/`+`v1/http3/` as writes so they are no
  longer silently exempt from the viewer guard. When identity resolution falls
  back (token present but `/me` unresolved) the scoped exclude-management
  capability now fails closed instead of defaulting open.
- Admin UI: scoped users can now create/edit/delete/simulate **throttle &
  traffic rules** (`v1/webdet/rules/*`) for their own in-scope vhosts. The
  controls page already showed the rule form to scoped users and the daemon
  already scope-checks these writes (`scopeAllowsVhosts`), but the client guard
  classified them as admin-only, so saving failed with `read-only scoped viewer
  token`.

## 2026-06-17

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — agent/contributor guide: architecture map, build/CI gates,
  enforced conventions, and a "where we historically lost the ball" section
  distilled from the first ~1000 PRs.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file. Changelog tracking starts from today; the
  date-based version scheme is now documented and maintained going forward.
