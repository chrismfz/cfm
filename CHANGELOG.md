# Changelog

All notable changes to CFM are recorded here.

**Versioning is date-based: the version *is* the release date** (`YYYY.MM.DD`,
from `date +%Y.%m.%d` in the Makefile). Each released `.deb`/`.rpm` produced by
`make release` carries that day's date, so every dated heading below
corresponds to a real package that was built and `make sync`'d out.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/):
group entries under **Added / Changed / Fixed / Security / Removed**. Work in
progress accumulates under **[Unreleased]**; on release day it moves under a
new `## YYYY.MM.DD` heading (see CLAUDE.md → "Releasing & CHANGELOG").

History before this file (the first ~1000 PRs, Mar–Jun 2026) is not
back-filled here — see the git/PR history for that period.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Admin UI: scoped (cPanel) viewer tokens can now toggle **Challenge/WAF and
  HTTP/3 for their own in-scope vhosts** from the per-vhost controls. The
  client-side write guard was blanket-blocking all writes for `viewer` tokens
  (`read-only scoped viewer token`) even though the daemon already authorises
  these mutations by host scope. Self-service writes are re-allowed client-side
  (the server still enforces the vhost allowlist); genuinely admin-only writes
  stay blocked. Also classifies `v1/waf/`+`v1/http3/` as writes so they are no
  longer silently exempt from the viewer guard. When identity resolution falls
  back (token present but `/me` unresolved) the scoped exclude-management
  capability now fails closed instead of defaulting open.

## 2026-06-17

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — agent/contributor guide: architecture map, build/CI gates,
  enforced conventions, and a "where we historically lost the ball" section
  distilled from the first ~1000 PRs.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file. Changelog tracking starts from today; the
  date-based version scheme is now documented and maintained going forward.
