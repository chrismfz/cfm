# Changelog

All notable changes to CFM are recorded here.

**Versioning is date-based: the version *is* the release date** (`YYYY.MM.DD`,
from `date +%Y.%m.%d` in the Makefile). Each released `.deb`/`.rpm` produced by
`make release` carries that day's date, so every dated heading below
corresponds to a real package that was built and `make sync`'d out.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/):
group entries under **Added / Changed / Fixed / Security / Removed**. Work in
progress accumulates under **[Unreleased]**; on release day it moves under a
new `## YYYY.MM.DD` heading (see CLAUDE.md → "Releasing & CHANGELOG").

History before this file (the first ~1000 PRs, Mar–Jun 2026) is not
back-filled here — see the git/PR history for that period.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## 2026-06-17

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — agent/contributor guide: architecture map, build/CI gates,
  enforced conventions, and a "where we historically lost the ball" section
  distilled from the first ~1000 PRs.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file. Changelog tracking starts from today; the
  date-based version scheme is now documented and maintained going forward.
